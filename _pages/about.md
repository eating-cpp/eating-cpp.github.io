Personal background
======
I was born in November 2003 in Xining, Qinghai, and currently study in Xi'an. When entering the Top Talent Class of Computer Science and Technology at Xidian University, I began to make progress together with top students from all over the country (to be more precise, engage in "involution"). Now, as a junior, I have finally finished all compulsory exams! I must reward myself with a delicious meal.
