My name is Yujie Li, a junior undergraduate student majoring in the Top Talent Class of Computer Science and Technology at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University. Want to learn more about my discipline or the Top-Notch Talent Base? Check it below! My research interests include, but are not limited to, computer vision, robotics, and large language models. I often post personal updates to record my recent research or study progress. Welcome to communicate with me!

Personal background
======
I was born in November 2003 in Xining, Qinghai, and currently study in Xi'an. When entering the Top Talent Class of Computer Science and Technology at Xidian University, I began to make progress together with top students from all over the country (to be more precise, engage in "involution"). Now, as a junior, I have finally finished all compulsory exams! I must reward myself with a delicious meal.

About XDU
-----
Xidian University is like a hidden "Electronic Tech Amusement Park" in Xi'an – while other universities enjoy poetry by the ancient city walls, our students play "Pictionary" with circuit boards at the foot of Qinling Mountains. The labs stay lit 24/7, not for parties but for coding marathons or "bedtime stories" to microcontrollers (aka debugging). The 5G-fed plane tree at the gate knows all: the students crouching under it are usually programmers who just got 虐哭 (mentally defeated) by algorithms, healing their souls with roujiamo (Chinese hamburgers). Here, mistaking "Operating System" for "Late-Night Snacking System" is a true Xidian vibe – because code waits for no one, but neither does a good meal!

About the Top Talent Class of Computer Science and Technology
-----
The Top Talent Class in Computer Science and Technology at Xidian University is a Base of the "Basic Disciplines Top-Notch Talent Training Plan 2.0" by the Ministry of Education. It aims to cultivate academic leaders in fields such as core computer fundamentals, network security, and artificial intelligence. The class enrolls 30 students annually through college entrance examination admission and post-enrollment selection, implements a dynamic adjustment mechanism, adopts an integrated bachelor-master-doctor cultivation model, and is equipped with a dual-tutor team (academic tutor + research tutor) composed of academicians, Distinguished Young Scholars, etc. The curriculum integrates the characteristics of mathematics, electronic information, and artificial intelligence. From the sophomore year, students engage in innovative training by connecting with research teams and are supported in overseas exchanges and learning of cutting-edge courses.

Wanna give it a shot? I promise you'll have a unique experience in the Top Talent Class!
