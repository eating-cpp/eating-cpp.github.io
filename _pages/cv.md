## About XDU
Xidian University is like a hidden "Electronic Tech Amusement Park" in Xi'an – while other universities enjoy poetry by the ancient city walls, our students play "Pictionary" with circuit boards at the foot of Qinling Mountains. The labs stay lit 24/7, not for parties but for coding marathons or "bedtime stories" to microcontrollers (aka debugging). The 5G-fed plane tree at the gate knows all: the students crouching under it are usually programmers who just got "虐哭" (mentally defeated) by algorithms, healing their souls with roujiamo (Chinese hamburgers). Here, mistaking "Operating System" for "Late-Night Snacking System" is a true Xidian vibe – because code waits for no one, but neither does a good meal!

## About the Top Talent Class of Computer Science and Technology
The Top Talent Class in Computer Science and Technology at Xidian University is a Base of the "Basic Disciplines Top-Notch Talent Training Plan 2.0" by the Ministry of Education. It aims to cultivate academic leaders in fields such as core computer fundamentals, network security, and artificial intelligence. The class enrolls 30 students annually through college entrance examination admission and post-enrollment selection, implements a dynamic adjustment mechanism, adopts an integrated bachelor-master-doctor cultivation model, and is equipped with a dual-tutor team (academic tutor + research tutor) composed of academicians, Distinguished Young Scholars, etc. The curriculum integrates the characteristics of mathematics, electronic information, and artificial intelligence. From the sophomore year, students engage in innovative training by connecting with research teams and are supported in overseas exchanges and learning of cutting-edge courses.
